PLEASE READ THE MANUAL (Download it from above)
This plugin creates a buffer around features of given type, without overlaps. A new field
named "Area" is created and updated in the result layer named "Buffer".
The "Input vector field" should preferably be a sequentially numbered Id reference field.
The user can use several options to adapt End Caps and Join Styles to her/his needs.
To run the plugin, go to Processing Toolbox, and click on Buffer Without Overlaps.
